Solving 8-Puzlze in C++

1.check out the puzzle.cpp it uses the A * search algorithm. 
2.the DIA.cpp uses deep iterative A star search algorithm but isnt yet fully working it runs an infinite loop theres some issues with the algorithm which will be fixed in due time but feel free to explore this code and modify it where necessary.

3.the Goal for this project is to compare these algorithms and other search algorithms and check which one is the fastest out of all for now i think the A * does a great job compared to the deep iterative algorithm but without fixing the DIA.cpp we dont really know which is faster.
