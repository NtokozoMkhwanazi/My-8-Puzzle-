Solving 8-Puzlze in C++


We are currently using vectors and Maps as our main containers in this project but that was to get the project up and running.
Now the goal is to use a Hash_Map or faster containers for our code, although we have already defined most of the node characteristics in the node class

Lasty the Seach algorithm i.e A* search, Depth-first Search or Deep iterative A* search.
I started off with the Depth-first Search because it was much easier to code But the ultimate goal is to use the Deep iterative A* search algorithm

this is an approach to 8-puzzle problem by junior Dev.
