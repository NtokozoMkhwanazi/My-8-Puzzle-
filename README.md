Solving 8-Puzlze in C++

1.check out the official.cpp it uses the A * search algorithm but the problem is with the level order traversal I'm trying to print the corresponding moves with the grid board or the entire tree which uses the A star search algorithm. 
2. the are folders Classes and helpful files which contains the fucntions used to produce the solution.
