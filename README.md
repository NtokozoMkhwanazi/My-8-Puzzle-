#AMATEUR ALGORITHMS BY AN AMATEUR DEV :) 

let us start by creating a basic tree just for understanding how we can represent generated grids as nodes.
then lastly the 8-Puzzle algorithm solver.

so i decided to use the manhattan distance to estimate the optimal grid that should be taken into account it works but not for all puzzles or for rather complex puzzles this means i should either change the way i estimate the distance between two points rather than use manhattan or optimize the manhattan distance part and pair it with another estimator.
This solver is still in its early stages of development but i think we are much closer to solving it than we were a few weeks ago.
:) stay positive champ.
